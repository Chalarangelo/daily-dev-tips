If you have been an avid reader of this blog, you might have noticed I like exploring different aspects of web development.

I don't like to niche down or restrict myself to one specific topic.
This might be because of my ADD nature or simply because I enjoy exploring all the different topics.

But today, I was deciding on what to write about. And from my list of open topics, I felt like there was too much to pick from.
Did I want to pick yet another completely new topic?

But then again, the topics I already wrote about seemed worn out. I touched on all the most important topics. Going into detail would mean writing long-form articles.

(This is something I'd love to do, but I don't have the energy for now)

## The power of broadcasting

I'm a big believer in broadcasting. It's something I've enjoyed throughout my life.

When I was young, I couldn't stick to one sport, I wanted to try them all out, and my parent was happy enough to let me.

Sometimes I would stick to a sport for a year or longer, but often I didn't enjoy them as much as hoped.

I think this was the nature of my personality. Just not someone who can do things for an extended period with no genuine interest in that particular thing.

And for me, this came with a fast amount of power. By always broadcasting my interest, I got to experience things I loved, but maybe more importantly, find the things I didn't like.

## How this can apply to you

So you might be wondering, ok, incredible life story, but what is it to me?

And as mentioned, I'm a firm believer in finding one's passion and genuinely experiencing what you enjoy most, so if you are reading this and unsure if you are doing the thing you love the most. Perhaps you should try to experience some other aspects of that thing.

Don't drop everything at once, but on the weekend, try out an alternative language, try out accessibility if you never did, try out data-science, or even backend development.

You might enjoy that even more than what you're doing now.

I hope this article will inspire some people to at least give it a think and perhaps experience to find the thing they love the most.
