When trying to dive into how to structure Storybook, I found it helpful to look at how other companies set them up.

And luckily for us, there is a full showcase section where many different Storybook examples are highlighted.

Some have modified their entire system to work uniquely, which is fantastic.

You can find the [Storybook showcase](https://storybook.js.org/showcase) here.

## Types of showcases

We can find a couple of different showcases, for instance, project-related ones.

These are more of a complete setup of projects using Storybook, and you'll find the likes of Shopify, Airbnb, and GitLab there.

However, we also get a section for components, which is super helpful as they showcase based on specific standard UI components.

You can find different companies' implementations of these common elements here.
Which, in return, is a super valuable asset to see how they set up the component and even the Storybook around it.

## Don't stop there

So you might also be looking at setting up a Storybook for your project or company.
And the cool part is you can also share it at the showcase to show off your hard work and share your unique style with the world.

You can use the [link](https://storybook.js.org/showcase/about) described here under "Add a project now" to add your one.

And to close off, which Storybook showcase did you find the neatest or best implementation?
