If you're on a Mac and use a Mail client that is not the default Mac Mail this article is for you.

More then once I've clicked a `mailto:info@daily-dev-tips.com` link and it opens that stupid Mac app instead of your own mail client.

This bugged me so much, so here is how you can change that default behaviour to be an application you want it to be.

The end result: (I'm using Spark)

## How to change the default Mail client on Mac

To actually make this change, we have to open the default Mail app.

Open the Preferences menu for the Mail app.

Now we need to change the default email reader.

That's it. Now your default mail actions will be through whatever you just set up.

I hope it helps you get rid of opening that default mail app  by default.

## Some good alternatives for Mac

Perhaps you're thinking cool, but what are some alternatives for Mac?

I'm personally using [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) because it comes with swipeable cards which help me maintain [Inbox zero](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/a-clear-mind-starts-with-a-clear-inbox/).

If your an outlook person, [Microsoft Outlook for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id985367838?mt=12) is pretty good!

I also heard good things about [Airmail](https://airmailapp.com/), but for me, Spark does everything I need, so never tried this one myself.

Perhaps you really like slick UI's and are not afraid to pay a little bit, then check out [Canary mail](https://canarymail.io/).
